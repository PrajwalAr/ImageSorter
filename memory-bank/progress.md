# Project Progress

## Current Status

- Core functionality implemented
- Electron packaging configured
- Security policies added
- UI/UX polished with Shadcn components
- Comprehensive unit testing setup with Vitest
- 100% test coverage for FileSelector component

## Implemented Features

1. CSV file selection with native dialog
2. Source/destination directory selection
3. Flexible matching (substring search)
4. Explicit matching (prefix + suffix)
5. File copying with progress feedback
6. Results display (copied/missing files)
7. Toast notifications for errors/success
8. Unit test coverage reporting

## Testing Milestones

- Implemented test-driven development workflow
- Created isolated component tests
- Achieved 100% coverage for initial component
- Configured CI-ready test runner

## Main Process Testing Progress

- Successfully refactored IPC handlers into dedicated module (ipcHandlers.js)
- Implemented manual testing script (test-main.js) for main process functionality
- Verified CSV parsing:
  - Correctly parses CSV files and emits 'csv-data' event
  - Handles errors and emits 'csv-error' event
- Verified image copying:
  - Creates destination directories when needed
  - Copies files successfully and reports results
  - Handles file copy errors with detailed error information
- Resolved path management issues by using absolute paths
- Added proper error handling for file operations

## 2025-07-17 Progress

- Enhanced CSV filename handling:
  - Added case-insensitive filename resolution
  - Support for filenames with/without extensions
  - Handles all casing variations (TEST.jpg, test.JPG, etc.)
  - Preserves original filenames in destination
- Created comprehensive test cases:
  - Test CSV with mixed filename formats
  - Test images for validation
- Removed unused ipcHandlers.js module

## 2025-07-16 Progress

- Fixed production deployment issues
  - Resolved production file path resolution in electron/main.js
  - Updated Forge configuration to remove redundant file copying
  - Verified macOS app bundle structure and functionality
- Completed end-to-end testing of macOS build
- Application now runs successfully in both dev and prod environments
- Created unified build scripts
- Resolved CSV parser dependency issues

## Next Steps

1. Expand test coverage to all components
2. Add end-to-end testing with Playwright
3. ~~Implement main process logic tests~~ (Completed via manual testing)
4. Build and package for distribution
5. User acceptance testing
6. Verify filename resolution across different filesystems

## Production Build Fixes (2025-07-16)

- Updated CSP policy to allow inline scripts
- Configured Vite with proper base path and asset handling
- Modified Electron main process to resolve production paths
- Verified production build loads correctly
